## Hop and Fork blog ##
This is the official blog for **Hop and Fork**. We built it on top of *Lanyon* theme.

### Writing a new post ###
You have to create a new file in `_posts` directory, giving it a name with
following format: `YYYY-MM-DD-Your-title.md` (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date
on which the post will result published).  

The post file will have following structure:

	---
	layout: post
	title: "Your title"
	category: Linux
	author: author_id
	comments: true
	---

	Post content, using Markdown syntax.

Note that `author_id` must be defined in `_data/authors.yml` file.

Remember to limit your lines to 80 characters.

Then, you just need to commit and push!
